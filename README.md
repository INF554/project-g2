Project Planning: Providing visualization for Animal Services Intake Data

Dataset: https://data.lacity.org/A-Well-Run-City/Animal-Services-Intake-Data/8cmr-fbcu

We can incorporate some visualizations such that:

(1) Create Proportional Symbol on the LA map to illustrate how many animals adopted by each shelter

(2) Create Sunburst chart to illustrate a relationship between animal's Group and Breed

(3) Create Time-Series chart to illustrate how many animals adopted per day/week/etc.

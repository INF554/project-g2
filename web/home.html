            <p>Our visualization is base on updated Austin shelter intake data from July 2013 to Nov 2016. We use <b>time Series chart</b> to investigate the trends of incoming and outgoing animals. We also use <b>geomap</b> to explore locations where adopted animals were found. Data can be displayed on animal type or time. <b>Sankey diagram</b> is used to reveal relationship between animal attributes and how these attributes effect adoption result. The last but not the least, we use <b>Calendar View</b> to display time when those animals came to and left the shelter and linked these information with animal found location. Author Vitid and Wenjia is aimed at provide multi-dimensional data visualization for shelter officer to explore the animal intake and outgoing information.</p>

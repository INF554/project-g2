            <p>We begin by exploring the overall operation of the shelter. We use <b>3 Line Charts</b> to display a number of <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Upper line">incoming</a>, <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lower line">outgoing</a>, and <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Middle line">leftover</a> animals for each month. The seasonal pattern can be easily spotted; the number of incoming & outgoing tend to increase and peak out around <b>May-Jun</b>, then decline and bottom out near <b>Dec-Jan</b>. Overall, the number of leftover animals are pretty stable. By <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="click 'All Animals'">separating the chart by animalType</a>, we found that even though most incoming/outgoing animals are dogs, their numbers are relatively stable throughout the years. Most fluctuations are actually <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="hover on any dots to get a clearer view">come from cats</a>.</p>

            <p>Found location of intake animals is heuristic, which can let people explore potential patterns in finding homeless animals. We use <b>geomap</b> to display top-10 <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Filled with orange">frequent area</a> in finding animals. Besides, people can choose to see frequent area base on total record, different animals, <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="From 2013 to 2016">years</a>, <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="From spring to winter">seasons</a>, <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="From morning to midnight">time in a day </a>. The opacity of orange represent how much animals are found here and people can click on the frequent area to see the exact number.</p>

            <p>There are multiple attributes to discribe animals. Here we use <b>sankey diagram</b> to display <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="width of the flow">the proportion</a> of these <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Nodes in the graph">attribute</a>. This graph includes both attribute for <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Prefixed with 'I.'"> incoming animals </a> and for <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Prefixed with 'O.'"> outgoing animals </a>. The graph is also include one nodes column for adoption infromation, providing people with further exploration, like how some feature of animal effect it been adopt or not.</p>

            <p>We narrow down our focus to <b>dog & cat</b>. We interest in how long does it takes for the pet owners to take their pet back. <b>Small Multiple</b> is used to display a relationship between the <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="X-axis">Animal's age</a> (upon intake) and the <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Y-axis & Line Chart">Median days</a> that the animals with this age range stayed until they were returned to their owner. For dogs, as they grow <b>older</b>, their owners tend to take them back <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="hover on any dots to get a clearer view">sooner</a>. This may suggest a <b>tighter relationship</b> between owner & dog as time go by. Surprisingly, such pattern is not observed in cats. Additionally, cat owners tend to take <b>longer</b> time to return their cat backs. By inspecting the <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Histogram Chart">number of cats</a> in each age range, we noticed that this may be because of an insufficient number of records.</p>

            <p>How about dog & cat that got their <b>new owner</b>? The relationship between the <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="X-axis">Animal's age</a> and the <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Y-axis & Line Chart">Staying duration</a> is explored in a similar manner. Compare to the above charts, it takes a longer time for both to find a new adopter. The number of adopted cats also <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="difference in Histogram between the 1st bar & the 2nd bar">decreases dramatically</a> as they grow older. This can be a bit unexpected consider the fact that cats have <b>lower maintenance cost</b> and usually <b>live longer</b>.</p>

            <p>Lastly, we found that some animals were taken by the shelter <b>multiple times</b>. This may indicates a <b>mistreatment</b> of pets. We provide a <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="select from the dropdown list">list of these animal</a>, along with their <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="animalId(number of Intake)\animalType\sex\breed\color">additional information</a>. We use <b>Calendar</b> to mark the event when they came to, and went out of the shelter. Users can also investigate <b>intakeCondition</b> and <b>outgoingCondition</b> by <b>hovering</b> on the corresponding cell or selecting <b>'showAllToolTips'</b>. <b>Geographical Map</b> is also used to mark the location where they were found. The <b>number</b> in the tooltips and markers indicates the <b>order</b> of Intake event. By <b>clicking on the Intake cell</b>, the map will focus to the associated event. While we expect that animals should be found in a similar area where they were previously discovered, some were found in a <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="select the first animal in the list and explore event#9, for example">very unusual, distant location</a>.</p>
